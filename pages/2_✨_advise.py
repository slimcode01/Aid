st.header("Increase Your Vitamin D")
st.write("""Most people donâ€™t get enough vitamin D. It can help protect against prostate cancer and many other conditions. 
         Vitamin D-rich foods include cod liver oil, wild salmon and dried shitake mushrooms. 
         Since the sun is a better, more readily available source of vitamin D, many experts recommend getting 10 minutes of sun exposure (without sunscreen) every day. 
         Doctors often recommend vitamin D supplements. However, you should talk to your doctor before taking any vitamin or supplement.
